An Enhancement Proposal is a way to propose, communicate, and coordinate new efforts for the `DBaaS Operator` project.

It is inspired by the following:
[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/README.md) and
[Service Binding](https://github.com/redhat-developer/service-binding-operator/blob/master/docs/proposals/README.md) enhancement
processes.

## Process

1. Draft a proposal under `docs/proposals`. Refer to the [proposal template](/docs/proposals/template.md).
2. Discuss the proposal with other contributors opening new issues. 
3. If the proposal is approved, submit a Pull Request.
   1. create a new directory in the format `NNN-Enhancement-Title`
   2. add your proposal based on the template and additional files to the new directory
   3. submit a pull request

## FAQs

**Do I have to use the process?**

Suppose the enhancement has a broad scope, yes. It helps everyone track why, when, how, and by whom work is done.

**Why would I want to use the process?**

Provide a mechanism to communicate design and implementation strategies across the DBaaS Operator community.

**My FAQ isn't answered here!**

Open an issue and ask, or even better, open a PR with a question and proposed answer.
